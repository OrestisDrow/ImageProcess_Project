# ImageProcess_Project

This is a 2 part personal project developed in 2017. Uses matlab for image processing. For more details check the presentation pdf's (in Greek)

## Brief project summary in English

### Part 1 contains
- 2D Forward and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discreet Cosin Transform (DCT) for images.
- Frequency space tools & filters (e.g. power, magnitude, phase, Low/High-Pass Filters  etc).
- Add gaussian/salt noise to an images.
- Edge Detection using sobel, robert masks.
- Some image filters (Wiener Filter, median filter etc).
- Image compression with DCT.
- Filtering out gaussian/salt noise.
- Histogram Equalization in RGV or HSI space.
- Image restoration

### Part 2 contains
- Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) compressed sensing recovery algorithm implementation.
- OMP for image compression & recovery.
